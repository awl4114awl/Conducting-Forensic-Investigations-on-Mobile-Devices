Introduction

Mobile devices are the most common computing platform in the world. They are also the most commonly used device for accessing the Internet. As we know from personal use, smartphones provide a variety of different features and allow users to perform almost every task previously done with computers. The capabilities provided by smartphones expand often, therefore the process for investigating mobile devices is constantly evolving.

 

Smartphones can (and do) substitute for desktop computers in almost every way because they are portable, always connected, and more convenient to use for most applications. As a result, smartphones carry immensely valuable information in many forensic investigations. They often provide recent chats, call logs, location data, pictures, and much more. In most cases, they carry more personal information than a traditional PC, which is why smartphones and other mobile devices often become the focus of modern forensic investigations. 

 

In this lab, you will use Paraben’s E3 to analyze data from iOS and Android smartphones.



Lab Overview

SECTION 1 of this lab has two parts, which should be completed in the order specified.

 

    In the first part of the lab, you will analyze an iOS data case, document evidence, and generate an investigative report using Paraben's E3.

    In the second part of the lab, you will use E3’s Mobile Evidence Comparer to compare two iOS data cases generated from the same device.

SECTION 2 of this lab allows you to apply what you learned in SECTION 1 with less guidance and different deliverables, as well as some expanded tasks and alternative methods. You will continue your investigation and analyze an Android data case.

 

Finally, you will explore the virtual environment on your own in SECTION 3 of this lab to answer a set of questions and challenges that allow you to use the skills you learned in the lab to conduct independent, unguided work - similar to what you will encounter in a real-world situation.



Learning Objectives

Upon completing this lab, you will be able to:

 

    Identify evidence within iOS data cases.

    Identify evidence within Android data cases.

    Compare different data cases from the same mobile device.

    Document evidence and generate a formal investigative report.

    Draft a Case Summary and Conclusion as part of a formal investigative report.
